# GROMACS 2020.7 release notes

This version was released on February 3rd, 2022. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in
GROMACS since the previous 2020.6 version, to
fix known issues.

## Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly

### Fixed bug with GPU LINCS occasionally shifting atoms in wrong direction

Due to missing blocking synchronizations in the CUDA version of LINCS,
the shared memory was occasionally overwritten with the new data. This
may slightly affect the final coordinates of the shifted atoms.

`4199`

### Fix calculation of restraint potential for large restraint deviations

The calculation in the code did not follow the description of the
potential in the manual but the potential continued to grow
quadratically instead of linearly as it should.

`4346`

## Fixes for `gmx` tools

## Fixes that affect portability

## Miscellaneous
