# GROMACS 2020.6 release notes

This version was released on March 4th, 2021. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in
GROMACS since the previous 2020.5 version, to
fix known issues.

## Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly

### Cosine acceleration failed to abort if it could not be run

Cosine acceleration is only compatible with the leap-frog integrator
(`integrator = md`). GROMACS did, however,
accept input files requesting cosine acceleration for other integration
algorithms, and did report viscosity-related quantities from these
simulations. Since the cosine acceleration was never applied in these
cases, any results obtained from simulations with enabled cosine
acceleration and integrators other than `md` should be regarded as
invalid.

`3903`

## Fixes for `gmx` tools

### Fix range checking bug in `gmx covar`

A check was inverted causing range checking to be applied wrong.

`3902`

## Fixes that affect portability

## Miscellaneous
