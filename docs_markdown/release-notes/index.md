# Release notes

These release notes record the changes made in all major and patch
releases of GROMACS. Major releases contain
changes to the functionality supported, whereas patch releases contain
only fixes for issues identified in the corresponding major releases.

Two version series of GROMACS are under active
maintenance and within support lifetime at any time. In 2027, they are
the 2027 series and the 2026 series. In the latter, only highly
conservative fixes will be made, and only to address issues that affect
scientific correctness. Naturally, some of those releases will be made
after the year 2026 ends, but we keep the year of the original release
in the version name so that users understand how up to date their
version is. Such fixes will also be incorporated into the more recent
release series, as appropriate. Around the time the 2028 release is
made, the 2026 series will no longer be maintained.

Where issue numbers are reported in these release notes, more details
can be found on the [issue tracker]() at that issue number.
