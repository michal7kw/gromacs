# Release notes for older GROMACS versions

Unfortunately, resources are finite and many versions of
GROMACS are no longer actively maintained.
This page records the release notes for all such versions, so that users
can find a record of the changes made in all major and patch releases of
GROMACS. Major releases contain changes to the
functionality supported, whereas patch releases contain only fixes for
issues identified in the corresponding major releases.

Where issue numbers are reported in these release notes, more details
can be found at <https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/issues> at that
issue number.
