# Beginners

For those just starting out with GROMACS and /
or `Molecular Dynamics Simulations ` it can be very daunting. It
is highly recommended that the various and extensive documentation that
has been made available for GROMACS is read
first, plus papers published in the area of interest.

## Resources

- GROMACS `/reference-manual/index/` - very
  detailed document that can also act as a very good introduction for
  `MD ` in general.
- `Flow Chart </user-guide/flow>`- simple flow chart of a typical
  GROMACS MD run of a protein in a box of
  water.
