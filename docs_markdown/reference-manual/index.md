bad


gmx_image_convert_possible

This part of the documentation covers implementation details of
GROMACS.


gmx_image_convert_impossible

The manual could not be properly build because we could not convert the
images for proper display without Imagemagick. The rest of the
documentation is still there, but this part here will be missing.


For quick simulation set-up and short explanations, please refer to the
`User guide <user guide>`.

Help with the installation of GROMACS can be
found in the `Install guide <install guide>`.

If you want to help with developing GROMACS,
your are most welcome to read up on the `Developer Guide <dev guide>`
and continue right away with coding for
GROMACS.
