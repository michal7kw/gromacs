This manual is not complete and has no pretension to be so, due to lack
of time of the contributors -- our first priority is to improve the
software. It is worked on continuously, which in some cases might mean
the information is not entirely correct.

Comments on form and content are welcome, please send them to the [user
discussion forum]() or the [developer discussion forum]() (see our
[webpage]() or this section on how to `contribute `), or
open an issue on our [issue tracker](). Corrections can also be made in
the GROMACS git source repository and uploaded
to the GROMACS [GitLab]().

We release an updated version of the manual whenever we release a new
version of the software, so in general it is a good idea to use a manual
with the same major and minor release number as your
GROMACS installation.
