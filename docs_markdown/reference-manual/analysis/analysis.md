# Analysis

In this chapter different ways of analyzing your trajectory are
described. The names of the corresponding analysis programs are given.
Specific information on the in- and output of these programs can be
found in the tool documentation `here `. The output files
are often produced as finished Grace/Xmgr graphs.

First, in sec. `usinggroups`, the group concept in analysis is
explained. `selections` explains a newer concept of dynamic selections,
which is currently supported by a few tools. Then, the different
analysis tools are presented.
